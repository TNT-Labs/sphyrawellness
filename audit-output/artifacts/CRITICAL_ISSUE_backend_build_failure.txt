CRITICAL ISSUE: Backend TypeScript Build Failure
=================================================

FILE: server/src/services/reminderService.ts
LINE: 34
SEVERITY: CRITICAL (Blocker)

ERROR:
------
error TS2352: Conversion of type 'ExistingDocument<{}>[]' to type 'Appointment[]' may be a mistake 
because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the 
expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type 'ExistingDocument<{}>' is missing the following properties from type 'Appointment': 
  id, customerId, serviceId, staffId, and 5 more.

IMPACT:
-------
- Backend cannot be built for production
- Docker build will fail
- Deployment is blocked
- TypeScript compiler rejects unsafe type conversion

REPRODUCTION:
-------------
cd server && npm run build

EXIT CODE: 1

RECOMMENDED FIX:
----------------
1. Review reminderService.ts:34 type assertions
2. Properly type the PouchDB query result
3. Add proper type guards or use 'as unknown as Appointment[]' with validation
4. Add runtime validation for the data structure
