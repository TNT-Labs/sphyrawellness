PATCH: 005-improve-ci-workflow.patch

ISSUE: Missing Quality Gates in CI/CD
FILE: .github/workflows/deploy.yml
SEVERITY: HIGH

PROBLEM:
Current GitHub Actions workflow only builds and deploys frontend.
No quality checks before deployment:
  - ❌ Lint not run (10 errors + 67 warnings can deploy)
  - ❌ Tests not run (broken tests can deploy)
  - ❌ npm audit not run (vulnerabilities can deploy)
  - ❌ Backend not built/tested

This means broken code can be deployed to production.

FIX:
Add quality gate jobs that run before build:
1. Frontend quality: lint + test + type check + audit
2. Backend quality: build + audit
3. Build job depends on quality jobs (needs: [quality, backend-quality])

If quality checks fail, build and deploy are blocked.

JOBS ADDED:

1. **quality** (Frontend):
   - npm run lint:strict (max 0 warnings)
   - npx tsc --noEmit (type check)
   - npm run test:run (unit tests)
   - npm audit --audit-level=high (security)

2. **backend-quality**:
   - npm run build (TypeScript compilation)
   - npm audit --audit-level=high (security)

3. **build** (modified):
   - needs: [quality, backend-quality]
   - Only runs if quality jobs succeed

WORKFLOW:
```
quality (frontend) ──┐
                     ├─→ build → deploy
backend-quality ─────┘
```

VALIDATION:
```bash
# Simulate workflow locally

# Frontend quality
npm ci
npm run lint:strict  # Should fail with current errors
npm run test:run
npm audit --audit-level=high

# Backend quality
cd server
npm ci
npm run build  # Should fail with current TypeScript error
npm audit --audit-level=high

# If both pass → build succeeds
npm run build
```

BREAKING CHANGES:
⚠️ This patch will BLOCK deployments until:
1. ESLint errors are fixed (patch 003)
2. Backend TypeScript error is fixed (patch 001)

Apply patches in order:
1. 001-fix-backend-typescript.patch
2. 003-fix-eslint-regex-errors.patch
3. 005-improve-ci-workflow.patch  ← This one

BENEFITS:
- ✅ Broken code can't reach production
- ✅ Tests must pass before deploy
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities blocked
- ✅ Type safety enforced
- ✅ Code quality standards enforced

METRICS TRACKED:
After this patch, GitHub Actions will track:
- Lint pass rate
- Test pass rate
- Build success rate
- Security audit status

OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS (future):
```yaml
# Add bundle size check
- name: Check Bundle Size
  run: |
    SIZE=$(stat -c%s dist/assets/*.js | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}')
    if [ $SIZE -gt 524288 ]; then
      echo "Bundle exceeds 512KB: $SIZE bytes"
      exit 1
    fi

# Add coverage threshold
- name: Coverage Check
  run: |
    npm run test:coverage
    COVERAGE=$(cat coverage/coverage-summary.json | jq '.total.lines.pct')
    if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 70" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "Coverage below 70%: $COVERAGE%"
      exit 1
    fi
```

EFFORT: 2 story points (~2 hours including testing workflow)

TESTING:
1. Create PR with intentional lint error
2. Verify quality job fails and blocks deploy
3. Fix error, verify workflow succeeds
