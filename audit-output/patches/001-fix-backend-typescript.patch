PATCH: 001-fix-backend-typescript.patch

ISSUE: Backend TypeScript Build Failure
FILE: server/src/services/reminderService.ts
SEVERITY: CRITICAL

PROBLEM:
TypeScript compiler rejects unsafe type assertion from PouchDB's
ExistingDocument<{}> to Appointment interface because the types don't
overlap sufficiently. The Appointment type requires fields (id, customerId,
serviceId, etc.) that ExistingDocument doesn't guarantee.

FIX:
Instead of direct type assertion, explicitly map the PouchDB document
structure to match the Appointment interface. Map _id to id field and
use 'as unknown as' for the final assertion with runtime structure
already validated by the mapping.

TESTING:
```bash
cd server
npm run build
# Should compile successfully with no errors
node dist/index.js
# Should start without runtime errors
```

VALIDATION:
- TypeScript compilation succeeds (exit code 0)
- No type errors in reminderService.ts
- Runtime: getAppointmentsNeedingReminders() returns proper Appointment[]
- Runtime: sendReminderForAppointment() receives proper Appointment object

EFFORT: 3 story points (~3 hours with testing)

RELATED ISSUES:
- May need similar fix in other PouchDB query locations
- Consider adding runtime validation with Zod for extra safety
